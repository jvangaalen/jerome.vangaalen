						<p> I am a family man to one beautiful wife and two also beautiful and wonderful daughters. I started out my career going to culinary school and working my way up through the ranks to rise to the level of executive chef! I have ran kitchens for the past eight years. Over the past couple of years I have found the culinary world to be alot different than when I started. 
						<p> I found that alot of the hard working and qualified people that worked for me in kitchens were people with degrees in computer sciences or IT. As the economy got back on its feet, all these people went to work in the fields of their study leaving the food and beverage industry with a vacancy to fill, and not many qualified people to fill them.</p>
						<p> Through my research I found that I can also become part of the technology world all these people have flocked to. I have also found that I don't neccaseraly need a degree in computer sciences to become part of the tech industry. So, through research and with a strong will, I started studying software development with Treehouse, an online coding school and reading Treehouse blogs and following other tech people through twitter and linkdin. My next step is to start working and learning even more with a company to earn a living and make this industry my new caree</p>
